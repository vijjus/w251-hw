# Lunar Lander on TX #

I trained 4 different models for the Lunar Lander. From reading the OpenAI info about the lander, as well as the code that was
provided, I concluded that the model is a function approximation of the Q-function in Reinforcement Learning. 

Given some input parameters such as the current location of the lander, the location of the flags etc, the output is the 
firing strength of the three thrusters on the lander - the left & right thruster and the thruster at the bottom.
