This notebook trained a BERT based classifier to predict the toxicity score of various texts. We implement a simple binary
classifier that predicts if a piece of text is toxic or not. We use the Huggingface BERT implementation in PyTorch. 
Huggingface has a pre-trained model called BertForSequenceClassification that is used.
